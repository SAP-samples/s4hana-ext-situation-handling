# SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensions: Situation Handling Automation
This repository contains the sample code for the [Situation Handling Automation tutorial](http://tiny.cc/s4-situation-handling).

*This code is only one part of the tutorial, so please follow the tutorial before attempting to use this code.*

## Description

The [Situation Handling Automation tutorial](http://tiny.cc/s4-situation-handling) uses the "Contract Is Ready as Source of Supply" situation type. The situation scenario covers contract handling in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

Every time a contract is created or changed, the system automatically checks whether there are purchase requisitions without a source of supply. Persons responsible receive a notification and can assign the contract as a source of supply to the purchase requisitions.

With this extension sample, the manual assignment is automated based on business rules maintained in the SAP SCP rules engine using the context information of business documents. In the sample, the rule is based on the Material Group belonging to the requested product. 


#### SAP Extensibility Explorer

This tutorial is one of multiple tutorials that make up the [SAP Extensibility Explorer](https://sap.com/extends4) for SAP S/4HANA Cloud.
SAP Extensibility Explorer is a central place where anyone involved in the extensibility process can gain insight into various types of extensibility options. At the heart of SAP Extensibility Explorer, there is a rich repository of sample scenarios which show, in a hands-on way, how to realize an extensibility requirement leveraging different extensibility patterns.
